# SDK
SDK examples for V2 series

This is a very simple example of how to read what users do (mouse/keyboard) in multiplex or switched mode.

Enable the SDK option in the settings of mousemux and also enable the 'target' window option. Then compile this example, on most compilers do:

gcc main.c -o main -lgdi32

run main.exe and then run MouseMux. You can now draw on the screen with any of the mice.
